## Project Description:
_The aim of this data analytics project is to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business strategies._

## Key Concepts and Challenges:
1. Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and relevant data.

2. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset, understand its structure, and handle any missing or inconsistent data.

3. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, etc.

4. Customer Segmentation: Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on behavior and purchase patterns.

5. Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments.

6.Insights and Recommendations: Analyze characteristics of each segment and provide insights.
